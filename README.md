When I first graduated I didn't think that coding was for me, in fact I hated to code. But when I discovered the depth of JavaScript and all the amazing things that I could do with that language I became hooked. Creating on the front end has helped me explore my artistic side. I love to explore the psychology aspect of UI design and to understand why we interact with machines the way we do.
